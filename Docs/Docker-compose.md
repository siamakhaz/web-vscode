# Docker-compose.yml Analysis

The `Docker-compose.yml` file defines the services to be created using Docker Compose.

## Specifications:

- It uses version "3.1" of the Docker Compose file format.
- Defines a single service named `vscode`.
- Builds the Docker image from the provided `.dockerfile`.
- Maps port 1988 on the host to port 8080 on the container, making the service accessible through `http://localhost:1988`.
- Defines multiple volume mappings to persist configuration, project files, and code-server data.
- Mounts the Docker socket to allow Docker commands to run inside the container.
- Sets environment variables to run the container as the `root` user and sets the password for the VSCode server to "imdragon".

The `Docker-compose.yml` is tailored to provide a web-based VSCode development environment with access to the host's Docker daemon.
